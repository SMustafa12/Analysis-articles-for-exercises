# Exact research on the theory of the blackbody thermal radiation

#### Review and perform numerical calculations related to the article "Research on the Theory of Blackbody Thermal Radiation" as an exercise

As an exercise and learning to research in physics, and most importantly, using what was learned in the university classroom or reading books and various sources, we came across this article to address it with the knowledge of the undergraduate level of physics, which I am halfway through the course, to challenge myself in analyzing the article and how to study it. We will proceed solely to analyzing the data and simulating and applying the new method in the distribution of blackbody radiation presented in the article using programming. I also used the Jupyter notebooks that I collected in the GitHub repository to use the experience of those who did the blackbody analysis.

In Jupyter notebook, to calculate the Boltzmann displacement law constant, which is obtained from Planck's law, in addition to the relationship mentioned in the article to obtain it, two textbook sources, Greiner and Zettili and Gasiorowicz, were used, and their methods were also studied.
